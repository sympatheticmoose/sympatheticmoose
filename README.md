### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm David
:rocket:  I'm currently working as a Product Manager @Grafana, focussing on making it easy to extend Grafana capabilities and bring yet more data into our open observability platform via plugins.

:shopping_cart: you can browse the [plugin catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/) to discover the rich ecosystem of available integrations and extensions.  

:book: you can check out documentation relating to plugins [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/).  

:hammer_and_wrench: we also provide open source tooling to help you [create](), [validate]() and [sign]() new plugins.  

:speech_balloon: If you want to chat or if I can be of assistance, DM me on the [Grafana Slack](https://slack.grafana.com/) `@David Harris`
