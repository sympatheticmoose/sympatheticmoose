### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm David
:rocket:  I'm currently working as a Product Manager [@Grafana](https://grafana.com/), focussing on making it easy to extend Grafana capabilities and bring yet more data into our open observability platform via plugins.

:shopping_cart: Browse the [plugin catalog](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/) to discover the rich ecosystem of available plugins - apps, data sources and panels.  

:book: Check out our [developer portal](https://grafana.com/developers/) to help guide plugin development.

:hammer_and_wrench: Leverage our open source tooling to help you [create](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grafana/create-plugin), [validate](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-validator/) and [sign](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grafana/sign-plugin) new plugins.  

:speech_balloon: If you want to chat or if I can be of assistance, DM me on the [Grafana Slack](https://slack.grafana.com/) `@David Harris`
